# DOM-quoteofday

Make a quote of the day generator:

1-Create a function that returns a random quote from the array of quotes that's given below. Note: Sometimes it's a good idea to create multiple functions, that do one specific thing only to make the code more readable and easier to maintain / extend. If you think they can be useful, put some comments to document your code.

2-Use modules to complete the task: you will need a javascript file for your quotes and then a main javascript file for your functionality. You will import your quotes into your main javascript file.

3-The user should be able to click a "Random Quote" button to generate one of your quotes. See image for reference
